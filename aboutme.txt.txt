I am a motivated and curious Digital Marketing enthusiast with a strong interest in understanding how data, content, and consumer behavior come together to drive business growth. Coming from a lower-middle-class background, I have learned to rely on self-learning, consistency, and adaptability to build my skills from the ground up.

I am particularly interested in content marketing, SEO fundamentals, social media strategy, and performance-driven campaigns. I enjoy analyzing trends, understanding audience intent, and crafting content that delivers both value and visibility.

Along with digital marketing, I have hands-on exposure to web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which helps me collaborate better with technical teams and understand how marketing integrates with products. I have also worked on AI-based and data-driven projects, strengthening my analytical mindset.

I am actively seeking an opportunity as a Digital Marketing Intern / Trainee, where I can apply my skills, learn from real-world campaigns, and contribute with creativity, discipline, and a strong willingness to grow.
